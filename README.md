# Movie recommendation system

This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on a user's preferences. 
It utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, to model different aspects of the system.
Users can provide input for their movie preferences, and the system generates a recommendation based on that input.
